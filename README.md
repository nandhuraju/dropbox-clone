# üì¶ Dropbox Clone DApp

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) that replicates core Dropbox functionality on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can upload, preview, view, and delete files with the help of smart contracts, decentralized storage (IPFS), and blockchain-based file management.

## üöÄ Features

- **MetaMask Wallet Integration**: Users can connect to the Ethereum blockchain via MetaMask.
- **File Upload**: Upload files directly to IPFS and store the file information (name, type, hash) on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **File Listing**: View files associated with your account from the blockchain.
- **File Preview**: Preview files (images, videos, PDFs) directly in the browser.
- **File Deletion**: Remove files from your account through a smart contract transaction.
- **IPFS for Decentralized Storage**: Files are stored securely on IPFS via the Thirdweb SDK.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: UI components and frontend interactions
- **Vite**: Fast development build and bundler
- **Tailwind CSS**: CSS framework for rapid styling
- **Ethers.js**: Ethereum library for interacting with the blockchain
- **MetaMask**: Wallet for connecting to the Ethereum network

### Backend
- **Solidity**: Smart contract development
- **Ethereum**: Blockchain network for contract deployment
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment and testing framework
- **Thirdweb SDK**: For IPFS integration and file storage

### Smart Contract

- **Upload File**: Stores file metadata (name, type, IPFS hash) on the blockchain.
- **Get Files**: Retrieves file information stored for a specific user.
- **Delete File**: Removes file metadata from the blockchain and user account.
